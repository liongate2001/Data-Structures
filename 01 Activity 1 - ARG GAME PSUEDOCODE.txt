Initialize the game:
- Set up the game window, display, and initialize variables (score, level, snake, food, etc.).

Main Game Loop:
- While the game is not over and the player hasn't defeated the boss level:
  - Handle user input (e.g., arrow keys to control the snake).
  - Update the snake's position based on user input.
  - Check for collisions with walls, food, and the snake's own body.
  - If the snake eats food, increase the score and check if the level is complete.
  - Render the game screen with the updated positions.

Level Initialization:
- Initialize the level-specific parameters (e.g., number of food items, food placement, obstacles, boss appearance conditions).

Level Complete Check:
- Check if the player has achieved the goal for the current level (e.g., collected all food items).
- If the goal is met, advance to the next level (or boss level if it's the final level).

Boss Level:
- If the current level is the boss level:
  - Initialize the boss character and its behavior.
  - Allow the player to fight the boss (e.g., by eating special items or avoiding attacks).
  - Determine if the player has defeated the boss and proceed accordingly.

Game Over:
- If the player fails to complete a level or is defeated by the boss, display a game over message and give the option to restart or exit.

Winning the Game:
- If the player successfully completes all levels, display a victory message.

End Game:
- Close the game window and release resources.

Game Logic Functions:
- Functions for moving the snake, checking collisions, updating score, rendering graphics, etc.
- Functions for level-specific actions and boss interactions.
